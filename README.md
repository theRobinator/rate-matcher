# Rate Matcher

This is a small math-based puzzle game that I made in under 36 hours for [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 51! Please
forgive any style or maintainability issues you find within.

The theme for this game jam was **every 10 seconds**. In this game, you have a device that pulses with a random
frequency and you must use math to turn that frequency into once every 10 seconds.

## Playing the game

The final product is hosted at https://robinwrotethis.com/rate-matcher/.

If you're stuck on one of the puzzles, you can open the developer tools and you'll find the solution printed
in the console.


## Dev Setup

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run watch # For dev; starts a server
$ npm run build-prod # For deployment
```

After running one of the build commands, open `dist/index.html` to see the game.
